# Soda-Dispensor
The soda dispensing machine vends 3 types of cool drinks in 3 different volumes- small,
medium and large. The cost of
A small drink = Rs.5
A medium drink = Rs.10
A large drink = Rs.15.
The currency has to be given in Rs.5 denomination only. A button is used to simulate the
entering of a coin. The user has to select the brand of cool drink he wants, the volume and then
enter the number of coins. After that, he should press the dispense button and the drink will be
poured if the number of coins entered are correct. Else the error LED will glow and the user has
to take back his coins. LED will glow to show if the corresponding brand of cool drink is not
available.
